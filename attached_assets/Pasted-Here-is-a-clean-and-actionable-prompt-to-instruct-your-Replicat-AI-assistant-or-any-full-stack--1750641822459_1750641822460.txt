Here is a **clean and actionable prompt** to instruct your Replicat AI assistant (or any full-stack AI agent) to perform a **full user account debug session** across all roles and access levels. This version avoids code formatting but gives specific and complete instructions.

---

**Prompt Title:**
Run a Full User Account Debug â€” URGENT Auth & Access Fix Required

---

**Context:**
Users across all access levels (free, pro, enterprise, admin) are experiencing account load failures. The account settings page displays "Failed to load profile." Additionally:

* After login, users are redirected incorrectly to `/app/editor` instead of `/home`.
* Admins are being forcefully logged out when visiting `/admin`.
* My own account (`annalealayton@gmail.com`) is supposed to have admin access but cannot manage or load profile data.

---

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Check Supabase Auth Config**

   * Validate that all user roles (free, pro, enterprise, admin) have correct `user_metadata` or `app_metadata`.
   * Confirm that `role` and `plan` are correctly assigned on sign-up or sign-in.
   * Ensure `admin` users are not being misclassified or logged out due to failed checks.

2. **Fix Profile Load Failures**

   * Debug why `GET /account/settings` is failing to load profile data.
   * Determine if this is a Supabase session, permissions, or database read error.
   * Validate that all required fields for rendering account settings exist and are populated in the DB.

3. **Audit Route Redirection Logic**

   * Ensure that after login:

     * Standard users go to `/home`
     * Admins can access `/admin` without logout
   * Fix any incorrect default redirects to `/app/editor`.

4. **Enable Admin Panel Access**

   * Grant immediate access to the `/admin` route for users with the admin role.
   * Confirm the route is protected only against non-admin users.

5. **Check Database Integrity Across Plans**

   * Ensure user plans (free, pro, enterprise) are loading properly and tied to actual Supabase rows.
   * Validate pricing and plan-based gating is not causing unintended errors.

---

**Outcome Required:**

* My admin account (`annalealayton@gmail.com`) must load fully and access `/admin` immediately.
* All user roles must load profile settings without failure.
* Login and access routes must behave correctly or I cannot onboard clients.
